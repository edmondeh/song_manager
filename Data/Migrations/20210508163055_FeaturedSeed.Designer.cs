Zeqiri's father was distant to her and to her mother, and she quoted that they haven't had contacts for more than 23 years. During a TV show in Klan Kosova, Dafina's father made a public speech asking her to forgive him, but Dafina never made any replies. In 2014, Zeqiri made a song with Ledri Vula, a Kosovar rapper from Pristina, whom she dated. There were a lot of rumors regarding their relationship, but they finally confirmed it during an acceptance speech in Videofest where the couple kissed. They later broke up.",
