Everybody's joking now<br>The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow!<br>Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope<br>There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't<br>Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows<br>His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope<br>He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows<br>When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's<br>Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody<br>Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and<br><br>You better lose yourself in the music<br>The moment, you own it, you better never let it go<br>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>You better lose yourself in the music<br>The moment, you own it, you better never let it go<br>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>You better…<br><br>His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping<br>This world is mine for the taking, make me king<br>As we move toward a New World Order<br>A normal life is boring; but superstardom's<br>Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder<br>Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over<br>These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows<br>He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads<br>God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father<br>He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<br>But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water<br>These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product<br>They moved on to the next schmoe who flows<br>He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera<br>Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner<br>But the beat goes on: da da dum da dum da da da da<br><br>You better lose yourself in the music<br>The moment, you own it, you better never let it go<br>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>You better lose yourself in the music<br>The moment, you own it, you better never let it go<br>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>You better…<br><br>No more games, I'ma change what you call rage<br>Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged<br>I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed<br>I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<br>But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher<br>Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper<br>All the pain inside amplified by the<br>Fact that I can't get by with my 9-to-5<br>And I can't provide the right type of life for my family<br>'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers<br>And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life<br>And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder<br>Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter<br>Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna<br>Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna<br>Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's<br>Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got<br>To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot<br>Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not<br>Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got<br>To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot<br>So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not<br>This may be the only opportunity that I got<br><br>You better lose yourself in the music<br>The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>You better lose yourself in the music<br>The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>You better…<br><br>You can do anything you set your mind to, man</div>",
